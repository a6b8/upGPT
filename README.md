# UP GPT

upGPT aims to curate and prepare learning resources and source code for artificial intelligence. This repository is intended to enable integration with the [upApi](https://github.com/a6b8/upAPI) for connecting to the OpenAI Custom GPT program and making educational content available in multiple languages.

The API and document generation modules have been published in separate repositories:

- https://github.com/a6b8/upAPI
- https://github.com/a6b8/sitemap2doc
